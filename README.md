# Tableau---Company-Sales

This repository contains a Tableau visualization designed to analyze and provide insights into sales and order management trends. The visualization explores various patterns and challenges in product sales, order blockages, and supply chain issues over the past two years.

#### Key Features:
Sales Trends: The visualization highlights fluctuations in sales, with noticeable peaks early in the year and a decline in the second half of 2025, making it challenging to predict consistent trends.

#### Product Categories:
It compares the value of prepacked and imported goods versus CTF products across different regions, showing how high-value items dominate in specific areas while others are sold in larger quantities but at lower prices.

#### Order Blockages:
The visualization tracks blocked orders, revealing that raw material shortages, stock issues, and credit constraints are key contributors to order disruptions.

#### Stock Availability: 
It identifies orders that are not blocked but still face stock shortages, highlighting potential inventory management gaps.

Purpose:
The goal of this visualization is to provide a clear overview of sales performance, order fulfillment issues, and supply chain bottlenecks. By analyzing these factors, it aims to help improve forecasting accuracy, streamline order processing, and optimize inventory management.
